# Unslop

**The internet was built for connection.**

Somewhere along the way, we became the product. Big Tech is engineered to spike your cortisol. They sell your focus to advertisers and bury real human connection under a mountain of algorithmic slop. They want you addicted. They want you doom-scrolling.

**Unslop is a quiet filter for the noise.**

It restores the internet to a tool for humans, not a Skinner box for retention metrics.

## Experience the silence

Unslop analyzes posts on your feed using a local-first classification engine and hides content that matches your quality filters:

- **LinkedIn**: Hides "Broetry", engagement bait, AI-generated slop, and viral hustle-porn.
- **X (Twitter)**: Filters rigorous engagement farming, rage-bait, and reply-guy spam.
- **Reddit**: Cleans up low-effort content and karma farming.

## 🔒 The Unit Economics of Privacy

Most apps hide their costs to sell you "unlimited" plans. Unslop doesn't do that because **we don't sell your data**.

- **No tracking**: Your browsing history never leaves your device.
- **No data sales**: We are funded by users, not advertisers.
- **Transparent**: What you see is what you get.
