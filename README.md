**Unslop** is a local-first browser extension that restores the social web to a human scale. It silently filters algorithmic noise, engagement bait, and AI-generated slop from your feeds, leaving only the signal.

> [!NOTE]
> **Early Access**: Currently available for LinkedIn. X (Twitter) and Reddit support is in active development.

## ⚡ The Signal

We believe your attention is a non-renewable resource. Unslop protects it by enforcing strict quality filters on your feed.

## 📥 Deployment

Unslop is distributed directly to users to avoid platform censorship and walled gardens.

1. **Download** the latest stable release from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. **Unzip** `unslop-extension-vX.Y.Z.zip` to a safe location.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
4. Toggle **Developer mode** (top right).
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder.

*No data ever leaves your device during classification.*

## 🧬 Privacy Protocol

**state: TRUSTLESS**

Unslop operates on a **zero-knowledge** architecture. We do not need to know what you read to filter what you shouldn't see.

- **Local Processing**: Content analysis happens on the edge or your device.
- **Ephemeral**: No browsing history is stored or transmitted.
- **Auditable**: What you see is the only code that runs.

## 💎 Unit Economics

We are funded by users, not ad-tech.
